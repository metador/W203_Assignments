When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
load("ceo_w203.RData")
```



The market value has continous variable.
While running a summary command you see there is big difference in the mean(=3450) and Median(=1200). This means that the data is positively skewed to the right with a lot data points close to the median and a relatively high number of of outliers with higher market value.


We see that there are some negative market value data points. These data points also have the profits as -1. 
This could potentially instances of missing data points and default value of -1 is recorded. So we will be considering them as na.

```{r}
summary(CEO$mktval)
CEO$mktval = ifelse(CEO$mktval == -1, NA, CEO$mktval)
summary(CEO)
```

The postive skew is clear in the histogram.

```{r}

ggplot(CEO,aes(mktval))+ geom_histogram(binwidth = 1000,fill ="red",col="black")
```

Since there is a large variation in the values we will be using the log of market value for our analysis.
The boxplot for the log of market value shows a more uniform distribution of data points
```{r}

ggplot(CEO,aes(y=log(mktval),x=1,color='red'))+ geom_boxplot()
```



We can see a high correlation between market value and profits, which is expected for most companies.
Similary we see a good correlation between log of market value and salary.


```{r}
cor(CEO$mktval,CEO, use="complete.obs")

ggplot(CEO, aes(x = log(mktval), y = log(profits), color = as.factor(1))) +geom_point() + stat_smooth(method = "lm",se=F)

ggplot(CEO, aes(x = log(mktval), y = salary, color = as.factor(1))) +geom_point() + stat_smooth(method = "lm",se=F)

cor(log(CEO$mktval),CEO$salary,use = "complete.obs")
```

From the boxplot for log of mktval vs grad, we can see that there is greater variation in the market price if you have a grad degree
```{r}
ggplot(CEO,aes(y=log(mktval),x=as.factor(grad),color='red'))+ geom_boxplot()

```



#Age
Age is a discrete variable.
Looking at the histogram plot, we can see that the variable is close to a  normally distributed curve with the mean(55) and median(57).
But you can see a drastic drop after the age of 65. 
This co-responds to the age of retirement in the US.

```{r}
summary(CEO$age)
ggplot(CEO,aes(age,color = as.factor(1)))+ geom_histogram(binwidth = 3,fill ="red",col="black")
```

If we simply plot a graph of age vs salary do not get any particular relation. The corelatoin is also very low(0.13)

```{r}
ggplot(CEO,aes(x=age,y=salary,color = as.factor(1)))+ geom_point()+ stat_smooth(method = "lm")
cor(CEO$age,CEO$salary)
```

Let us examine age variable closely. 
Since age is a discreet variable let us group the salary's of all the CEOs of the same age.
We can take mean of all the salary's in each group.
On ploting the mean salary against the age we see an interesting trend
We see that within the age range 29 to 75 there might be a corelation between average salary and age.
This is also the range which has the maxium data points

```{r}

grouped = group_by(CEO, age)
mean_salary_age = summarise(grouped, mean_salary = mean(salary, na.rm = T))
ggplot(mean_salary_age,aes(x=age,y=mean_salary,color = as.factor(1)))+ geom_point()  + stat_smooth(method = "lm")
cor(mean_salary_age)

```

Let Narrowing age from 29  to 75 
We see a high co-relation between mean salary and the age within the age range 29 to 75

```{r}
narrowed_mean_salary_age=mean_salary_age[mean_salary_age$age<=75 & mean_salary_age$age>=29,]
ggplot(narrowed_mean_salary_age,aes(x=age,y=mean_salary,color = as.factor(1)))+ geom_point()  + stat_smooth(method = "lm")
cor(narrowed_mean_salary_age$age,narrowed_mean_salary_age$mean_salary)
```
